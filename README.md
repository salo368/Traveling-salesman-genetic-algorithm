Genetic Algorithm for Traveling Salesman Problem Optimization

This project utilizes a genetic algorithm approach to find approximate solutions to the TSP. Genetic algorithms are techniques inspired by biological evolution that use operators such as selection, crossover, and mutation to iteratively improve a population of candidate solutions.

## Features

- Random generation of initial populations.
- Genetic operators for reproduction and solution improvement.
- Calculation of route cost and evaluation of individual fitness.
- Elitism to preserve the best solutions in each generation.
- Stopping criteria to control algorithm convergence.
- Generation-wise visual representation of the evolving solutions in MP4 format.

## Demonstration

You can find an example of the algorithm's execution for 20 locations over 200 generations:
